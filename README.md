## Hi, my name is Paweł!

Welcome to my profile, not much to see here yet but looking forward to changing that!
I have over 3 years of experience in developing commercial CMS systems in django framework + python (since november 2021).
Always searching for better solutions to my issues or code improvements, it might somehow work but does it work in the most optimal way? If not, we are meant to change that.
